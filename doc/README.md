# AWS Flow Framework for Ruby Sample Code Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the AWS Flow Framework for Ruby sample code distribution on GitHub.

**Before building the docs, you'll need the following:**

* Python 2.7.5+
* The `docutils` module.

**To build:**

1. Open a command-line (terminal) window.

2. Change to the directory where this file is located on your machine. If you downloaded and unzipped the samples to your downloads directory, for example, you can type:

        cd ~/Downloads/aws-flow-ruby-samples/doc

3. Run `make_readmes`, which is a Python script. If your system supports running Python scripts directly (most Linux/OS
    X/Unixes), you can simply type:

        ./make_readmes

    Otherwise, you may need to specify Python:

        python ./make_readmes
