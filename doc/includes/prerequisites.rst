Prerequisites
-------------

The *AWS Flow Framework for Ruby* is required, which can be obtained and installed using the information here:

- https://aws.amazon.com/swf/flow/

If you already have Ruby_ and RubyGems_ installed, you can install the framework
and all of the gems required by the samples by opening a terminal window,
changing to the directory where you've cloned or downloaded the samples, and
typing::

    bundle install

This will install all of the requirements that are listed in the `Gemfile` in
the repository's base directory.

For more information about setting up the AWS Flow Framework for Ruby, see `Installing the AWS Flow Framework for
Ruby`_ in the *AWS Flow Framework for Ruby Developer Guide*.
