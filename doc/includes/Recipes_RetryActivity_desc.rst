The **RetryActivity** recipes show how to:

* apply a retry policy to *all invocations of an activity*
* specify a retry policy for an *activity client*, a *block of code*, or for a *specific invocation of an activity*
* retry activities *without jitter*, or with *custom jitter logic*
* retry activities with *custom retry policies*
