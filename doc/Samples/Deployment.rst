Run the Sample
--------------

**To run the Deployment sample:**

1. Open a terminal window and change to the ``lib`` directory in the location where you cloned or unarchived the sample
   code. For example::

    cd ~/Downloads/aws-flow-ruby-samples/Samples/Deployment/lib

.. step 2 is common to all samples.
.. include:: ../includes/credential_step.rst

3. Execute the following commands on your command-line::

    ruby deployment_activity.rb &
    ruby deployment_workflow.rb &
    ruby deployment_workflow_starter.rb

   Alternately, you can execute the `run_deployment.sh` script to run all of these commands at once.

.. In the future, we'll include the "About the Sample Code" section right here...
