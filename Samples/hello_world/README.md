AWS Flow Framework for Ruby: HelloWorld Sample Application
==========================================================

The *HelloWorld* sample uses a very simple workflow that calls an
activity to print Hello World. It shows basic usage of the framework,
including implementing activities and workflow coordination logic and
building workers to run the workflow and activities.

Prerequisites
-------------

The *AWS Flow Framework for Ruby* is required, which can be obtained and
installed using the information here:

-   [https://aws.amazon.com/swf/flow/](https://aws.amazon.com/swf/flow/)

If you already have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/) installed, you can install the
framework by opening a terminal window and typing:

~~~~
gem install aws-flow
~~~~

For more information about setting up the AWS Flow Framework for Ruby,
see [Installing the AWS Flow Framework for
Ruby](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsrbflowguide/installing.html)
in the *AWS Flow Framework for Ruby Developer Guide*.

Downloading the Sample Code
---------------------------

To view or download the code for all of the AWS Flow Framework for Ruby
recipes and samples, go to:

-   [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-flow-ruby-samples](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-flow-ruby-samples)

Run the Sample
--------------

**To run the HelloWorld sample:**

1.  Open *three* separate terminal windows and, in each one, change to
    the `lib` directory in the location where you
    cloned or unarchived the sample code. For example:

    ~~~~
    cd ~/Downloads/aws-flow-ruby-samples/Samples/hello_world/lib
    ~~~~

2.  In each command-line (terminal) window, execute the following
    commands, substituting your AWS Access keys for the example values.

    On Linux, OS X or Unix:

    ~~~~
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-key'
    export AWS_REGION='your-aws-region'
    ~~~~

    On Windows:

    ~~~~
    set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
    set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
    set AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
    ~~~~

3.  Execute the following commands, one in each of the terminal windows:

    ~~~~
    ruby helloworld_activity.rb

    ruby helloworld_workflow.rb

    ruby helloworld_workflow_starter.rb
    ~~~~
