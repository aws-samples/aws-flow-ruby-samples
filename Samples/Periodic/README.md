Run the Sample
--------------

**To run the Periodic sample:**

1.  Open a terminal window and change to the `lib`{.docutils .literal}
    directory in the location where you unarchived the sample code. For
    example:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
cd ~/Downloads/Periodic/lib
~~~~

3.  Execute the following commands on your command-line:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
ruby error_reporting_activity.rb &
ruby periodic_activity.rb &
ruby periodic_workflow.rb &
ruby periodic_workflow_starter.rb
~~~~

    Alternately, you can execute the run\_periodic.sh shell script to
    run all of these commands at once.
