# Hello World Tutorial Code

These are the source files for the "Hello, World!" tutorial that appears in the AWS Flow Framework for Ruby Developer
Guide, here:

* <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsrbflowguide/helloworld.html>

It is based on (and tries to stay up-to-date with) the [hello_world sample][helloworld-sample] code in the master branch
of:

* <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-flow-ruby-samples>

This version is kept on the separate `documentation` branch to keep the master branch clean, while still providing
a publicly-accessible location for the tutorial code.
