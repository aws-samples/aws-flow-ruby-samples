Run the Sample
--------------

**To run the Deployment sample:**

1.  Open a terminal window and change to the `lib`{.docutils .literal}
    directory in the location where you unarchived the sample code. For
    example:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
cd ~/Downloads/Deployment/lib
~~~~

3.  Execute the following commands on your command-line:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
ruby deployment_activity.rb &
ruby deployment_workflow.rb &
ruby deployment_workflow_starter.rb
~~~~

    Alternately, you can execute the run\_deployment.sh script to run
    all of these commands at once.
