Run the Sample
--------------

**To run the CronWithRetry sample:**

1.  Open a terminal window and change to the `lib`{.docutils .literal}
    directory in the location where you unarchived the sample code. For
    example:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
cd ~/Downloads/CronWithRetry/lib
~~~~

3.  Execute the following commands on your command-line:

~~~~ {.literal-block}
ruby cron_with_retry_activity.rb &
ruby cron_with_retry_workflow.rb &
ruby cron_with_retry_workflow_starter.rb
~~~~

    Alternately, you can execute the run\_cron.sh script to run all of
    these commands at once.
