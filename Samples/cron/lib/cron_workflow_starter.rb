# @param job [Hash] information about the job that needs to be run. It
#   contains a cron string, the function to call (in activity.rb), and the
#   function call's arguments. The jobs should be short lived to avoid creating
#   a drift in the  scheduling of activities since the workflow will wait for
#   the job to finish before it continues as new.
# @param base_time [Time] time to start the cron workflow
# @param interval_length [Integer] how often to reset history (seconds)

# The internal length should be longer than the periodicity of the cron job.
# We have selected a short interval length (127 seconds) so that users can
# see the workflow continue as new on the swf console. The number 127 was
# particularly selected because it is the first prime number after 120
# (120 seconds = 2 minutes)

# Get the workflow client from CronUtils and start a workflow execution with
# the required options
